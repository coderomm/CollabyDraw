### 🖌️ CollabyDraw: Collaborative Canvas Meets Solana

---

#### 🚀 Project Summary  
**CollabyDraw** is a real-time collaborative drawing app where users co-create visual art in shared rooms. We're integrating Solana to let users **mint their collaborative artwork as NFTs**, making it possible to **own, preserve, and showcase creative moments on-chain**.

This bridges the gap between creative collaboration and decentralized ownership using the power of Solana NFTs.

---

#### 🧠 Problem Statement  
Digital creativity is often trapped inside centralized tools. Collaborative art sessions are temporary, with no on-chain permanence, attribution, or ownership. There’s a clear need for **authentic, co-owned, and immutable records of digital creativity**.

---

#### 🌐 Solution Overview  
By integrating Solana, CollabyDraw enables:

- 🔐 **Phantom Wallet Login** for creator authentication  
- 🖼️ **One-click NFT Minting** of exported drawings  
- 📜 **On-chain Metadata** including title, description & contributor addresses  
- 🗃️ **Decentralized Storage** via Arweave/IPFS  
- 🎨 A smooth UX blending creativity and blockchain ownership
